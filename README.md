[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jaredlander/useful.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jaredlander/useful)

`Useful` is a collection of handy functions that I have collected over the years but do not have a place in an particular package. More are added as I build.

Since `useful` is so varried I will, over time, add example use cases to this README.

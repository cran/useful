[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jaredlander/useful.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jaredlander/useful) [![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/useful)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=useful) [![Downloads from the RStudio CRAN mirror](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/useful)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=useful)

`Useful` is a collection of handy functions that I have collected over the years but do not have a place in an particular package. More are added as I build.

Since `useful` is so varried I will, over time, add example use cases to this README.
